Place for all freebies from Kwippe.com, vector art and characters in SVG and PNG formats.

All of the awesome vector files in this repo were made with the free Kwippe App, which you can use online at [Kwippe.com](http://www.kwippe.com). Exporting to SVG format does require a Pro membership, which is $9.99 (one time fee). Sorry about the fee but we have to pay our server bill somehow :)
